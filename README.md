1.) Explain the differences between Cassandra 
and typical databases.
S.No. CASSANDRA
RDBMS
1.
Cassandra is a high performance 
and highly scalable distributed 
NoSQL database management 
system.
RDBMS is a Database 
management system or 
software which is designed for 
relational databases.
2.
Cassandra is a NoSQL database.
RDBMS uses SQL for querying 
and maintaining the database.
3.
It deals with unstructured data.
It deals with structured data.
4.
It has a flexible schema.
It has fixed schema.
5.
Cassandra has peer-to-peer 
architecture with no single point of 
failure.
RDBMS has master-slave core 
architecture means a single 
point of failure.
6.
Cassandra handles high volume 
incoming data velocity.
RDBMS handles moderate 
incoming data velocity.
7.
In RDBMS there is limited data 
source means data come from 
many locations.
In Cassandra there are various 
data source means data come 
from one/few location.
8.
It supports simple transactions.
It supports complex and nested 
transactions.
9.
In Cassandra the outermost 
container is Keyspace.
In RDBMS the outermost 
container is database.
10.
Cassandra follows decentralized 
deployments.
RDBMS follows centralized 
deployments.
11.
In Cassandra data written in many 
locations.
In RDBMS mainly data are 
written in one location.
12.
In Cassandra row represents a 
unit of replication.
In RDBMS row represents a 
single record.
13.
In Cassandra column represents 
a unit of storage.
In RDBMS column represents 
an attribute.
14.
In Cassandra, relationships are 
represented using collections.
In RDBMS relationships are 
represented using keys and 
join etc.
2.) What exactly is CQLSH?
• cqlsh is a command-line interface for 
interacting with Cassandra using CQL 
(the Cassandra Query Language). It is 
shipped with every Cassandra package, 
and can be found in the bin/ directory 
alongside the cassandra executable
3.) Explain the Cassandra cluster idea.
• A Cassandra cluster does not have a 
single point of failure as a result of the 
peer-to-peer distributed architecture. 
Nodes in a cluster communicate with 
each other for various purposes. There 
are various components used in this 
process: Seeds: Each node configures a 
list of seeds which is simply a list of 
other nodes
4.) Give an example to demonstrate the class 
notion.
• Python is an object oriented 
programming language. Almost 
everything in Python is an object, with 
its properties and methods. A Class is 
like an object constructor, or a 
"blueprint" for creating objects.
EXAMPLE:-
• class MyClass:
x = 5
5.) Use an example to explain the object.
• Example of class and object For 
example, Person(Human) can be 
treated as a class which has properties 
such as name, age,gender etc. Every 
individual can be treated as an object 
of the class human or Person. Each 
individual will have different values of 
the properties of class Person.
